## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc,<br> using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard<br>library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, … is forbidden.
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples.<br> You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have <br>to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account).<br> We will use our own main.c files at compilation.<br> Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your<br> header file called search_algos.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
